There is a well cited statistic that data scientitsts and ML engineers spend over 80% of their time cleaning and preparing data, and the exciting part of building models is really only a small part of their work. As job roles and responsibilities between data engineers/data scientists/AI engineers/DevOps/MLOps all start to collide and blur, it's clear that the glamour of being an AI engineer means being good at data grunt work. So, just as I'm dedicating time to learning the higher level maths and software engineering that underpins AI, I'm also making sure I'm constantly practicing my basics.

As a football analogy -- I always spend 15-20 mins after each training session practicing free kicks. Refining what is a very specialised technique for a pretty rare moment in the game of football. Scoring off a free kick (like building a model) is a thing of beauty and skill, and it will surely get you on the highlight reel. But there's no point being a specialist free-kick taker if you can't complete a basic pass. The reality is, if you can't complete passess, you won't be on the field to begin with to even take the free kick. And so, I also spend about 15-20 mins *before* training passing the ball against the wall or with a teammate, practicing and refining my basic technique. It's the same in the data world -- if you can't do the basics right to extract and clean data, then you're not going to have anything to build the model on. 

I'll be honest, although I've used SQL for a few work projects, it's not something I use on a daily basis. The majority of my work projects have required NoSQL DBs (like Mongo) or ingesting and manipulating data using Pandas/DAX/MQuery. Because of this, I've had to make a conscious effort to practice SQL. 

So whether you're starting SQL for the first time or, like me, using it to keep your basic skills sharpened and level up to more advanced techniques, here are a few of my favourite SQL resources.

### <a href="https://sqlbolt.com/" target="_blank">SQL Bolt</a> ###
There are plenty of interactive SQL tutorials (Select Star, Code Academy, W3 Schools) but SQL Bolt is by far my favourite UI and follows a really intuitive lesson flow. It was the perfect tutorial to do 2-3 lessons each morning. It's more towards the beginner end but make sure you check out "More Topics" to get some high level content. Their curriculum looks like it's still evolving and growing so be sure to check back. The same team has also developed a great <a href="https://regexone.com/" target="_blank">Regex equivalent</a>.

Presented in an 8 week challenege format, this set of tutorials is visual, interactive and the learning progression has been well designed and thought out. The great thing is you are dealing with real data in the context of simulated business challenges. Highly recommend.

Alex has 3 good playlist series which cover <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaB-1hjhk8GT6N5ne2qpf603sF26m2PW" target="_blank">beginner</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaB-1hjhk8HTgPnBukmMq7QTe83ANirL" target="_blank">intermediate</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaB-1hjhk8EBZNL4nx4Otoa5Wb--rEpU" target="_blank">advanced</a> SQL topics in nicely packaged 5-15 minute videos. They're perfect to watch or code along with during my morning coffee time.

### Kaggle SQL Tutorials ###

* <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/advanced-sql" target="_blank">Kaggle Advanced SQL Micro-Course</a>

Kaggle has 2 great courses to take you from intro to advanced SQL topics. I particularly like that Kaggle delivers the content in their browser based kernel/notebook and uses the BigQuery API for their dataset. I find that most SQL courses only give you familarity with Microsoft SQL Server or isolated SQL statements on an interactive webpage. But the Kaggle course throws you in the deep end a little bit, makes you question the validity of your data (rather than giving you a perfect working dataset) and provides exposure to real-world tools and processes for querying public datasets.

Another interactive tutorial with beginner, intermediate, and advanced sections. The advanced content covering subqueries and performance tuning are particularly well explained.
