There is a well cited statistic that data scientitsts and ML engineers spend over 80% of their time cleaning and preparing data, and the exciting part of building models is really only a small part of their work. As job roles and responsibilities between data engineers/data scientists/AI engineers/DevOps/MLOps all start to collide and blur, it's clear that the glamour of being an AI engineer means being good at data grunt work.

As a football analogy -- I always spend 15-20 mins after each training session practicing free kicks. Refining what is a very specialised technique for a pretty rare moment in the game of football. Taking free kicks, like building models, is exciting and fun. But there's no point being a specialist free-kick taker if you can't complete a basic pass -- if you can't pass, you won't be on the field to begin with. So, I also spend about 15-20 mins before training passing the ball against the wall or with a teammate, practicing and refining my fundamental skills and technique. It's the same in the data world -- if you can't extract and clean data, then you're not going to have anything to build the model on. 

So whether you're starting SQL for the first time or, like me, using it to keep your basic skills sharpened and level up to more advanced techniques, here are a few of my favourite SQL resources.

### <a href="https://sqlbolt.com/" target="_blank">SQL Bolt</a> ###
If you're just starting SQL, there are plenty of interactive SQL tutorials (Select Star, Code Academy, W3 Schools) but SQL Bolt is by far my favourite UI and follows a really intuitive lesson flow. The same team has also developed a great <a href="https://regexone.com/" target="_blank">Regex equivalent</a>.

Presented in an 8 week challenge format, this set of tutorials is visual, interactive and the learning progression has been well thought out. Each lesson gives you real data in the context of simulated business challenges. Highly recommend.

Alex has 3 great playlist series which cover <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaB-1hjhk8GT6N5ne2qpf603sF26m2PW" target="_blank">beginner</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaB-1hjhk8HTgPnBukmMq7QTe83ANirL" target="_blank">intermediate</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaB-1hjhk8EBZNL4nx4Otoa5Wb--rEpU" target="_blank">advanced</a> SQL topics in nicely packaged 5-15 minute videos.

### Kaggle SQL Tutorials ###

* <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/advanced-sql" target="_blank">Kaggle Advanced SQL Micro-Course</a>

Kaggle has 2 awesome courses to take you from intro to advanced SQL topics. I particularly like that the content is delivered in Kaggle's browser based kernel/notebook and uses the BigQuery API for the dataset. I find that most SQL courses only give you familarity with Microsoft SQL Server or isolated SQL statements on an interactive webpage. But, unlike most courses, the Kaggle tutorials provide exposure to real-world tools and processes for querying public datasets.

### <a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/" target="_blank">Mode SQL Tutorial</a> ###
Another interactive tutorial with beginner, intermediate, and advanced sections. The advanced content covering subqueries and performance tuning are particularly well explained.
