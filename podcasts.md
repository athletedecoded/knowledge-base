# Podcasts

I love learning, and that doesn't stop even when I'm training. I typically listen to podcasts when I'm at the gym or on the bike, and it's the perfect window to fit in a 60-80 min episode. It's mind-body training all in one hit, and I feel both mentally and physically invigorated aftwerwards. 

I have a few go-to shows and they fall into two pretty distinct categories - personal growth and nerdy tech talks. Here are a few of my favourite shows and episodes that I highly recommend giving a listen.

### <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/podcast/home" target="_blank">Towards Data Science (TDS) Podcast</a> ###
Hands down my favourite AI podcast at the moment. I am really passionate about AI-driven social equality and acknowledge that AI technology has an increadbile power to address some of our most complex global challenges. However, without proper attention, AI also has the potential to amplify social barriers and biases. TDS has done a fantastic series exploring AI ethics, trust, and human-alignment. Every single episode has expanded my awareness on responsible AI. Here are a few of my faves, but seriously go listen to them all!
