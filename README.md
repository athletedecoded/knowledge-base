For me, knowledge is more than the consumption of information - it's about reaching a depth of learning and understanding to put that information into action.

I love learning and exploring new topics, and in the process I've curated some fantastic resources. I continue to use these resources frequently and they have formed a significant part of my learning "curriculum".

My content consumption is wide ranging -- I enjoy watching short YouTube explainers while I'm having my morning coffee..I listen to podcasts while I'm exercising..I love the rigour and depth delivered in MOOC courses..and as an active learner, I naturally gravitate to interactive and highly visual learning resources.
