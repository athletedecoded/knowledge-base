For me, knowledge is more than the consumption of information - it's about reaching a depth of learning and understanding to put that information into action.

This repo serves as a Knowledge Base of awesome resources I've curated along my learning journey. You'll notice it includes a bit of everything...

... I enjoy watching short YouTube explainers while I'm having my morning coffee
... I listen to podcasts while I'm exercising
... I love the rigour and theory delivered by university courses and MOOCs
... I naturally gravitate to highly visual and interactive content 

Hopefuly by sharing, these resources will empower your learning and understanding too :)
