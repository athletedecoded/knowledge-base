For me, knowledge is more than the consumption of information - it's about reaching a depth of learning and understanding to put that information into action.

This repo serves as a Knowledge Base of awesome resources I've curated along my learning journey. 

I enjoy watching short YouTube explainers while I'm having my morning coffee..I listen to podcasts while I'm exercising..I love the rigour and depth delivered in MOOC courses..and as an active learner, I naturally gravitate to interactive and highly visual content. 

Hopefuly by sharing, it will empower your learning too :)
